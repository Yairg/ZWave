ZWave Program Controller
========================

This repository contains the code for a program that duplicates a ZWave network settings to a ZWave controller. The program also configures scenes on the controller.

# Assumptions:
1. You have a control think stick that is the network primary controller
2. I tested this with Intermatic Home Settings HA07 Master controller and Intermatic Home Settings HA07 Handy remote.
